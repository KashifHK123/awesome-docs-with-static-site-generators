## Short Story

I believe that the best way of learn things is to play with them. Learning by example first, then reading and learning more details and theory. I think it is mainly because I'm just to dumb to understand the idea or any concept even if it is well described. If I would be a neanderthalian and somebody would try to explain to be what fire is, I would never understand it. I would have to light it on my own few times, get my first burns and first grilled zucchini.

What I'm trying to explain here is ... :) that my adventure with static site generators started, because I could use somebody's work. I could play with it to quickly see what I can do and to quickly set up a sample that I could present in my company to drive a change. Now you have all the links in one place, you don't have to spend to much time on research.

## About

This repo is suppose to give you just a bunch of links. They will help you to quickly get some good samples to play with a static site generator that you are interested with.

## Inspiration

You can inspire and you can be inspired by others. I always hope to do both and so far it works well for me. I've attended few conferences as a speaker and I know I inspired few people already (at least thay told me that). I'm not closed though, I'm getting inspired by people, by ideas, by projects, by simple blog posts, sometimes even tweets.

I hope this simple list of all projects will inspire you to play with static site generators, same way as I got inspired by https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs to create this project.
